Vialer Android
==============
README

Vialer is a VoIP client which utilizes the VoIPGRID platform. Up until version 3.0 it's main purpose is to provide an easy interface for the "Two step Calling" function of the platform. This feature enables the user of the app to dial a phone number as if you were "at the office". The receiver sees the "office" number as the calling number (CLI). Using the app, the user can also:

- Adjust its availability
- See call statistics
- See and adjust dialplans

Starting from Version 3.0 the app also acts as a VoIP softphone, enabling the user to make and receive phone calls using SIP but only when connected to WiFi of 4G.

## Technical implementation
On an outgoing call the app registers itself with VoIPGRID's sip proxy and after the call has ended the registration is removed. We have deliberately chosen for this registering/deregistering process to avoid "dangling" registrations on the proxy when the phone goes out of proper internet coverage.

On an incoming call, the phone is notified through a silent push notification through firebase. When this notification is received the device will check the quality of the internet connection. If the connection is WiFi or 4G the app will register with the proxy. When registered the device will be called and the device will wake up with a pick-up screen.

To be able to sent the push notifications a piece of "middleware" software has been developed. A device registers at this middleware with a firebase token used to sent a notification to the device. This token will be used to wake the device when an incoming call needs to be placed.

## Prerequisites
- To be able to use the application you will need an account from one of the VoIPGRID partners
- You will need a active firebase configuration for the app and middleware to be able to receive incoming calls.
